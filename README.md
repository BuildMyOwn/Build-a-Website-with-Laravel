# Build a Website with Laravel

This page documents the entire process of me developing a website that sells APIs.

It is not a small project, but a complete project that can run in a production environment. Building such a project takes a long time, so please make sure you have enough patience.

It would be my great honor if it can help you. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Users in mainland China may encounter many problems, please make sure that your network can smoothly access certain international websites.## What does it include

Laravel

Unit Testing

Nginx

Docker

GitHub Actions

TailwindCSS

Kong(API Gateway)

Linux

## Runtime Environment

All further operations will be performed on macOS because the author uses macOS.
